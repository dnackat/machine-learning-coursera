Hi Dileep â€“

Again I apologize for the long delay.  I have been trying to figure out how to do this which is difficult for me.

 

I spoke with Venkat M today about this and he has offered to help us make this arrangement work.  Venkat will give you a call soon to discuss some options with you.  I really hope you are still interested in joining JZ!  I would certainly like to work with you again.

 

--Mike
